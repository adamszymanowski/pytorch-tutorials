    "# A Gentle Introduction to torch.autograd\n",
    "`torch.autograd` is PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine that powers neural network training.\n",
    "In this section, you will get a conceptual understanding of how autograd helps a neural network train.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background \n",
    "Neural networks (NNs) are collection of nested functions that are executed on some input data.\n",
    "These functions are defined by *parameters* (consisting of weights and biases), which in PyTorch\n",
    "are stored in tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a NN happens in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Propagation**: In forward prop, the NN makes its best guess about the correct output. It runs the input data through each of its functions to make this guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward Propagation**: In backprop, the NN adjsts its parameters proportionate to the error in its guess. It does this by traversing backwards from the output, collecting the derivatives of the error with respect to the parameters of the functions (gradients), and optimizing the parameters using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage in PyTorch\n",
    "Let's look at a single training step. For this example, we load a pretrained resnet18 model from `torchvision`. We create a random data tensor to represent a single image with 3 channels, and height & width of 64, and its corresponding `label` initialized to some random values. Label in pretrained models has shape (1,1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This tutorial work only on CPU and will not work on GPU (even if tensor are moved to CUDA)."
